This project implements basic functionality of elliptic curve cryptography, and applies Pollardâ€™s rho algorithm to compute discrete logarithms on small elliptic curves.

This project is an assignment for TCSS 543 Advanced Algorithm Autumn 2019.


## Project structure

- `ECPoint`: a set of operations on points on elliptic curves.
    - `point()`: returns a elliptic curve point.
    - `mul()`: returns the product of two elliptic curve points `a1` and `a2`.
    - `exp()`: returns the exponentiation `a^m` of a elliptic curve point `a`.
    - `rho()`: the discrete logarithm operation, using Pollard's rho algorithm.
    - `check()`: generates a random `m` and calculates `b = a^m`, then calculates `m' = log_a{b}` and check if `m = m'`.
- `SextupleInitializationException`: reports method rho()'s failure for the simple initialization of the sextuple.
- `Driver`: the main program. There are four different parameter sets, on each of which 1000 discrete logarithms are performed and an average number of step `k` is computed.


## Results & analysis

A screenshot of the program running is as follows.

We have already known that Pollard's rho algorithm runs in $O(\sqrt{n})$ time, where $n$ is the order of the elliptic curve. In the program running shown above, each parameter set's `n` is approximately 4 times of that in the previous set, and the number of steps `k` is approximately twice. This confirms that my implementation of Pollard's rho algorithm does run in $O(\sqrt{n})$ time, and is very likely to be correct -- I think it is.
